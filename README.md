# eComm

The project is just a small working example of an e commerce site.
You can have users, admins and role is decided after the user logs in.
Display and order products from your site.
Keep track of order and its status.

## Installation

After you pull the code -
Run **npm install** in the main directory to run both server and client together.
Move into client folder and run **npm i** to install client side dependency.
Move into server folder and run **npm i** to install server side dependency.

## Running the project

Now you can run the project by running **npm run dev** on parent directory

## Note

You might not be able to see server side data.
It is because I have not shared the passwords publically.
Contact me if you really want to see the database data and its working.
